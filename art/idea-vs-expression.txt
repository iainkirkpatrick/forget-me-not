JG: The album is more musical than For Emma. Was that a conscious aim for you?

JV: I guess so. There wasn't too much aim in general for this record. I think it ended up being a record that was very musical because I think in many ways, as a musician growing up listening to a lot of different music and being influenced by different types of recordings, I was really ready to make a record that involved a lot of that color. But I didn't want to think about it. I didn't want it to be an idea. I wanted it to be an expression rather than an idea. And it ended up becoming an expression that is an idea, which is a nice place to end up.

JG: Expression versus idea. Can you elaborate slightly?

JV: I think an idea... we can all sit around and say, "Wouldn't it be cool to get two rhinoceroses to stand upside down and then paint them red and then everyone would look at it because it would mean this or that" or some kind of artistic for art's sake, or art for art's sake, or improvisation for improvisation's sake. I think that's cool, and there's been plenty of people that have furthered the envelope in art and music because of their experimentation. But I think for me, the music that has always resounded with me — and art as well — is when it feels a little bit like it's coming from a person. And it's coming from a visceral place. A place that is maybe trying to explain something that isn't explained yet. And I guess that's what I was trying to do, and by trying to write songs in a subconscious way, I've ended up with something I'm pretty proud of that I didn't know I was capable of doing.
